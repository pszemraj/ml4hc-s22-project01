# Results - README

> This is a README file for the results of evaluating classifiers on the MITBIH and PTBDB datasets.

## Layout

1. Metrics for each classifier trained on the MITBIH dataset and the PTBDB dataset as individual models are in the `results\initial-training` folder.
2. Metrics for each classifier trained on the MITBIH dataset and the PTBDB dataset as ensemble models are in the `results\ensemble-training` folder.
3. In addition to our efforts, we also tested autoML solutions on the MITBIH dataset and the PTBDB dataset from the [autogluon library](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon). The results are in the `results\automl-baseline` folder.
4. All images, plots, etc. are in the `results\figures` folder.
